# How to Integrate Xendit Payment Gateway in WordPress with Paymattic

Xendit is a leading payment gateway that simplifies online transactions for businesses in Indonesia, the Philippines, and across Southeast Asia. By integrating Xendit with **Paymattic**, you can offer your customers a wide array of local and international payment options, such as:

-   VISA
-   Mastercard
-   American Express
-   JCB
-   Local bank transfers
-   E-wallets
-   And many more

This comprehensive guide will walk you through every step of configuring the Xendit payment gateway on your WordPress site using **Paymattic**.

::: warning Prerequisites
To get access to the [Xendit](https://www.xendit.co/en/) payment gateway, you need the [Paymattic Pro Plugin](/getting-started-with-paymattic/how-to-install-and-activate-paymattic-in-wordpress).
:::

## Configuring the Xendit Payment Method

The following steps will establish the core connection between **Paymattic** and your Xendit account. This is a one-time setup that involves installing the Xendit add-on, obtaining API keys, and configuring webhooks for seamless communication.

### Step 1: Install and Activate the Xendit Add-on

Unlike some other gateways, Xendit integrates with **Paymattic** via a dedicated add-on that you must activate first.

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **Paymattic** → **Payment Gateway**.
2.  Select the **Xendit** tab from the left sidebar to view the **Xendit Settings** page.
3.  You will see an **Install and Activate Xendit** button. Click this button to connect the Xendit module with your **Paymattic Pro** plugin.

::: info Note
This add-on needs to be installed the first time you integrate with Xendit.

### Step 2: Choose Your Payment Mode

After activation, you can set up the basic configuration. First, decide if you want to process live transactions or run tests.

1.  **Select your Payment Mode**:
    -   **Test Mode**: This is a secure sandbox environment for testing your payment forms without using real money.
    -   **Live Mode**: Choose this when you are ready to accept real payments from your customers.
    
    For this guide, we'll select **Test Mode**. The process is identical for both.

2.  To connect your account, you will need a **Test Secret Key** from your **Xendit Account**. We will retrieve this in the next step.

### Step 3: Generate and Copy Your Secret Key from Xendit

The Secret Key is a vital credential that authorizes **Paymattic** to process payments through your Xendit account. Here’s how to generate one.

1.  Open a new browser tab and log in to your [Xendit Account](https://dashboard.xendit.co/settings/developers#callbacks).
    
    ::: tip
    If you don't have an account, [sign up here](https://dashboard.xendit.co/register).
    :::

2.  Once you are in the **Xendit Dashboard**, navigate to the **Settings** menu on the left sidebar. Under the **Developers** section, click on **API Keys**.

![Xendit Settings - API Keys](/images/payment-method-fields/how-to-integrate-xendit-in-wordpress/Xendits-Settings-section-API-key-under-Developer-tab-scaled.webp)

3.  On the API Keys page, click the **+ Generate secret key** button to begin creating a new key.

![Generate Secret Key](/images/payment-method-fields/how-to-integrate-xendit-in-wordpress/Generate-Secret-Key.webp)

4.  Now, you must configure the permissions for your new API key. These settings control what **Paymattic** is allowed to do within your Xendit account.
    -   Give your key a recognizable **Name** (e.g., "Paymattic Integration").
    -   Set the following **Permissions** to `Write` or `Read` as specified, to ensure full functionality:
        -   Money-in Products – Write
        -   Money-out Products – Write
        -   Balance – Read
        -   Report – Write
        -   Transaction – Read
        -   xenPlatform (Account) – Write
        -   xenPlatform (Account Holder) – Write
        -   xenPlatform (Split Payments) – Write
        -   xenShield (Transaction Assessments) – Write
    -   Click the **Generate Key** button.

![API Key Configuration](/images/payment-method-fields/how-to-integrate-xendit-in-wordpress/Generate-API-Key-popup-page.webp)

5.  A success popup will appear showing your newly generated key.
    -   Click the **Copy** button to copy your **Secret API Key** to your clipboard.
    -   **Important**: Xendit will only show you this key once. Make sure to paste it into Paymattic immediately or save it temporarily in a secure location.

### Step 4: Finalize the Configuration in Paymattic

With the Secret Key copied, you can now complete the primary setup in your WordPress dashboard.

1.  Return to the **Paymattic** → **Payment Gateway** → **Xendit** tab.
2.  Paste the **Secret Key** you just copied into its corresponding field.
3.  Click **Save Settings** to complete the integration.

## Optional: Additional Configuration

After the main setup, **Paymattic** offers a few extra settings to fine-tune your Xendit integration.

#### Invoice Duration & Customer Notification

These settings control the payment invoice lifecycle and how customers are notified.

1.  **Invoice Duration**: From this dropdown, you can select how long an invoice remains valid before it expires. If you want to use the default duration set in your Xendit dashboard, simply choose **None**.
    
2.  **Customer Notification Preference**: Select your preferred notification settings for customers from the available options.

::: warning Important
Always click **Save Settings** after making any changes to your Xendit Settings.

## Crucial: Configure Webhooks

Webhooks are essential for reliable payment processing. They allow Xendit to send real-time notifications back to your website, automatically updating payment statuses from 'Pending' to 'Paid'. Without this, you would have to update every transaction manually.

::: warning Important
To ensure your Xendit dashboard and Paymattic dashboard stay synchronized, you must configure Xendit Webhooks.
:::

#### Step 1: Get the Webhook URL from Paymattic

The first step is to copy the unique notification URL from Paymattic.

1.  In the Xendit settings page within **Paymattic**, find the Webhooks section and copy the **Webhook URL**.
2.  This URL is the specific address that Xendit will send notifications to for transaction synchronization.

![Webhook URL in Paymattic](/images/payment-method-fields/how-to-integrate-xendit-in-wordpress/Webhook-URL-Events.webp)

#### Step 2: Set the Webhook URL in Xendit

Now, you need to provide this URL to Xendit.

1.  Go back to your [Xendit Dashboard](https://dashboard.xendit.co/settings/developers#callbacks).
2.  Navigate to **Settings** → **Developers** → **Webhooks**.

![Xendit Webhook Settings](/images/payment-method-fields/how-to-integrate-xendit-in-wordpress/Webhooks-under-Developers-tab-of-Xendit-Setting-scaled.webp)

3.  In the **Invoices** section, where you configure notifications for completed payments:
    -   Paste the **Webhook URL** you copied from Paymattic into the provided field.
    -   Check the **Notification Boxes** for "Paid/Expired" to ensure you receive updates for these events.
    -   Click **Test and Save** to confirm the URL is working and save the configuration.

## Using Xendit in Your Payment Forms
