Mollie is a fantastic payment gateway for your webshop. This article will guide you through configuring Mollie on your WordPress Site with the Paymattic plugin.

Remember, to get access to the [Mollie](https://mollie.com/) payment gateway, you need the [Paymattic Pro Plugin](/# 1-toc-title).

## Configuring Mollie Payment Method

To learn how to configure the Mollie payment gateway through Paymattic, follow the steps with screenshots below â€“

First, go to **Payment Gatewa**y from the **Paymattic Navbar**, click the **Mollie** tab from the left sidebar, and the **Mollie Settings** page will open.

Select any **Payment Mode** between **Test** (for test payments) and **Live** ( for real payments) as both options follow the same configuration process, e.g., I choose the **Test Mode**.

Then, you need to obtain the **Publishable key** from your **Mollie Account**.

### Get the API Key from Mollie

First, log in to your Mollie account from [here](https://my.mollie.com/dashboard/login). If you do not have account, sign up from [here](https://my.mollie.com/dashboard/signup).

Once you log in to the **Mollie Dashboard**, go to the **Developers** section from the **Navbar**, and the **API keys** tab will appear.

Copy the **Live API Key** to activate **Live mode** if Live is chosen as the payment mode.

## Add Mollie in Forms

Once you finish setting up your **Mollie** payment gateway, you can easily add this payment method to any of your existing [Payment Form](/how-to-create-your-first-payment-form-in-a-minute-and-accept-payments-with-paymattic).

If you do not have any existing forms, read[ Create a Form from Scratch](/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) or[ Create a Form using Templates](/simple-form-templates) documentation.

To learn the detailed process of adding a payment method to an existing form, read this [Documentation](/how-to-use-the-payment-method-fields-section).

But, remember, the added **Mollie** payment method in your **Form** will not function unless you complete the configuration process properly.
