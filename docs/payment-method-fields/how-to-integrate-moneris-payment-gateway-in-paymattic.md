# How to Integrate Moneris Payment Gateway in Paymattic

[Moneris](https://www.moneris.com/) is one of Canada's leading payment processors, offering secure and reliable services to help you accept payments on your WordPress site. Integrating Moneris with **Paymattic** allows you to leverage their trusted network directly from your payment forms.

This detailed article will guide you through the entire process of configuring the Moneris payment gateway with your **Paymattic** plugin.

::: warning Prerequisites
To get access to the [Moneris](https://www.moneris.com/) payment gateway, you need the [Paymattic Pro Plugin](/getting-started-with-paymattic/how-to-install-and-activate-paymattic-in-wordpress).
:::

## Configuring the Moneris Payment Method

The Moneris integration is a multi-step process that involves activating the add-on in Paymattic, getting three separate credentials from your Moneris account, and then entering them back into Paymattic. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a successful setup.

### Step 1: Install and Activate the Moneris Add-on

The Moneris gateway connects to **Paymattic** via a dedicated add-on. Your first step is to activate it.

1.  From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **Paymattic** → **Payment Gateway**.
2.  Select the **Moneris** tab from the left sidebar to open the **Moneris Settings** page.
3.  Click the **Install and Activate Moneris** button to enable the module.

::: info Note
This add-on only needs to be installed the first time you integrate with Moneris.

### Step 2: Set the Payment Mode

After activation, you can begin the basic configuration.

1.  **Select your Payment Mode**:
    -   **Test Mode**: This lets you test your forms using Moneris's sandbox environment without processing real money.
    -   **Live Mode**: Select this when you are ready to accept real payments.
    
    Both modes follow the same configuration steps. For this guide, we'll use **Test Mode**.

2.  **Identify Required Credentials**: To complete the integration, you will need to retrieve three pieces of information from your Moneris account: a **Store ID**, an **API Token**, and a **Checkout ID**. The next steps will show you how to find them.

### Step 3: Retrieve Your Credentials from Moneris

This is the most detailed part of the process. We will walk through how to log in to your Moneris account and find all three required keys.

1.  Open a new browser tab and log in to your [Moneris Account](https://www.moneris.com/en/login-portal-hub).
