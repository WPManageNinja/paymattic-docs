[Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/) also allows you the **Offline** feature to avoid the hassle of collecting payments online. This feature lets your customers exit the checkout page without paying online and can pay through direct bank transfer or cheque. Another edge of Offline payment is, that it is very user-friendly for those customers who do not want to provide card information online. This article will guide you through the process of how you can integrate the Offline payment option in your WordPress Site with Paymattic.

## Configuring Offline Payment Method

To learn how to configure the Offline payment gateway through Paymattic, follow the steps with screenshots below â€“

First, go to **Payment Gatewa**y from the **Paymattic Navbar**, click the **Offline** tab from the left sidebar, and the **Offline Settings** page will open.

Select any **Payment Mode** between **Test** (for test payments) and **Live** (for real payments) as both options follow the same configuration process, e.g., I choose the **Test Mode**.

Now, click the **Save Settings** button to save your preferred payment mode.

## Add Offline in Forms

Once you finish setting up your **Offline** payment gateway, you can easily add this payment method to any of your existing [Payment Form](/how-to-create-your-first-payment-form-in-a-minute-and-accept-payments-with-paymattic).

If you do not have any existing forms, read[ Create a Form from Scratch](/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) or[ Create a Form using Templates](/simple-form-templates) documentation.

To learn the detailed process of adding a payment method to an existing form, read this [Documentation](/how-to-use-the-payment-method-fields-section).

But, remember, the added **Offline** payment method in your **Form** will not function unless you complete the configuration process properly.
