## Configuring the Offline Payment Method

Setting up the offline payment gateway in **Paymattic** is incredibly simple. It's essentially a matter of enabling the option so you can add it to your forms. Here's how to do it.

### Step 1: Navigate to the Offline Settings

First, you need to find the Offline gateway configuration panel within your Paymattic dashboard.

1.  From your WordPress admin panel, go to **Paymattic** â†’ **Payment Gateway**.
2.  In the list of available gateways on the left, click on the **Offline** tab.
3.  This will open the main **Offline Settings** page.

### Step 2: Set the Payment Mode and Save

The only setting required for the offline method is to choose your operational mode.

1.  **Select your Payment Mode**:
    -   **Test Mode**: Use this to test your form submissions without cluttering your live transaction records.
    -   **Live Mode**: Use this to accept real payment pledges from your users.
    
    Both modes function identically for this payment method. For this guide, we'll select **Test Mode**.

2.  Click the **Save Settings** button to apply your changes. The Offline gateway is now active!

-   For an **existing form**, simply edit the form, add the **Payment Method** field from the input fields panel, and ensure that 'Offline' is enabled as an option.
