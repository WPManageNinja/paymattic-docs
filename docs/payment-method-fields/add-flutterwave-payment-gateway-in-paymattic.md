Flutterwave unlocks boundless payment opportunities for enterprises, individuals, small businesses, emerging markets, and startups alike. This article will guide you through configuring Flutterwave on your WordPress Site with the Paymattic plugin.

Remember, to get access to the [Flutterwave](https://flutterwave.com/us/) payment gateway, you need the [Paymattic Pro Plugin](/# 1-toc-title).

## Configuring Flutterwave Payment Method

To learn how to configure the Flutterwave payment gateway through Paymattic, follow the steps with screenshots below –

First, go to **Payment Gatewa**y from the **Paymattic Navbar**, click the **Flutterwave** tab from the left sidebar, and the **Flutterwave Settings** page will open.

Click the **Install and Activate** **Flutterwave** button to connect Flutterwave with Paymattic.

This add-on needs to be installed the first time you integrate with Flutterwave.

Select any **Payment Mode** between **Test** (for test payments) and **Live** ( for real payments) as both options follow the same configuration process, e.g., I choose the **Test Mode**.

Then, you need to obtain the **Public and Secret** **Key** from your **Flutterwave** **Account**.

#### Get the Public Key &amp; Secret Key from Flutterwave 

To learn how to get the **Public key** and **Secret key** from your [Flutterwave](https://flutterwave.com/us/), follow the steps with screenshots below –

### Add Flutterwave Webhooks

To learn how to configure the **Xendit Webhooks** to your WordPress Site, follow the steps with the screenshots below –

To ensure your Flutterwave dashboard and Paymattic dashboard are in sync, you must configure the Xendit Webhooks.

First, copy the **Webhook URL** for smooth transactions based on **Flutterwave Data.
You will need them later to configure Flutterwave Webhooks to your WordPress Site.

Now, visit your [Flutterwave Dashboard](https://dashboard.flutterwave.com/), go to the **Settings** section from the left sidebar, and click the **Webhooks** under the **Developers** tab.

Paste your copied **Webhook URL** into the **URL** field, enter **wpf\_flutterwave\_listener** as the **Secret hash**, and click the **Save** button.

Also, you can select your **Webhook Preferences** according to your needs by checking the boxes.

## Add Flutterwave in Forms

Once you finish setting up your **Flutterwave** payment gateway, you can easily add this payment method to any of your existing [Payment Form](/how-to-create-your-first-payment-form-in-a-minute-and-accept-payments-with-paymattic).

If you do not have any existing forms, read[ Create a Form from Scratch](/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) or[ Create a Form using Templates](/simple-form-templates) documentation.

To learn the detailed process of adding a payment method to an existing form, read this [Documentation](/how-to-use-the-payment-method-fields-section).

But, remember, the added **Flutterwave** payment method in your **Form** will not function unless you complete the configuration process properly.
