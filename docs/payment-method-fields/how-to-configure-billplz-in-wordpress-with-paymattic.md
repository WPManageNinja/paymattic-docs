Billplz is a payment gateway platform for organizations to pay and get paid the fastest at the lowest cost possible. This article will guide you through configuring Billplzz on your WordPress Site with the Paymattic plugin.

Remember, to get access to the [Billplz](https://www.billplz.com/) payment gateway, you need the [Paymattic Pro Plugin](/# 1-toc-title).

## Configuring Billplz Payment Method

To learn how to configure the Billplz payment gateway through Paymattic, follow the steps with screenshots below â€“

First, go to **Payment Gatewa**y from the **Paymattic Navbar**, click the **Billplz** tab from the left sidebar, and the **Billplz Settings** page will open.

Select any **Payment Mode** between **Test** (for test payments) and **Live** ( for real payments) as both options follow the same configuration process, e.g., I choose the **Test Mode**.

Then, you need to obtain the **Collection ID** and **Secret** **Key** from your **Billplz Account**.

### Get the Collection ID and Secret key from Billplz 

First, log in to your [Billplz Account](https://www.billplz.com/#). If you do not have an account, sign up from [here](https://dashboard.billplz.com/enterprise/signup).

Once you log in to the **Billplz Dashboard**, click the **Dropdown Arrow,** and open the **Settings** section from the left sidebar.

## Add Billplz in Forms

Once you finish setting up your **Billplz** payment gateway, you can easily add this payment method to any of your existing [Payment Form](/how-to-create-your-first-payment-form-in-a-minute-and-accept-payments-with-paymattic).

If you do not have any existing forms, read[ Create a Form from Scratch](/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) or[ Create a Form using Templates](/simple-form-templates) documentation.

To learn the detailed process of adding a payment method to an existing form, read this [Documentation](/how-to-use-the-payment-method-fields-section).

But, remember, the added **Billplz** payment method in your **Form** will not function unless you complete the configuration process properly.
