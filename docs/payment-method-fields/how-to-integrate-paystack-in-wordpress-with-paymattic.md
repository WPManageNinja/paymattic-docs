Paystack enhances the payment process of your WordPress website. This article will guide you through configuring Paystack on your WordPress Site with the Paymattic plugin.

Remember, to get access to the [Paystack](https://paystack.com/) payment gateway, you need the [Paymattic Pro Plugin](/# 1-toc-title).

## Configuring Paystack Payment Method

To learn how to configure the Paystack payment gateway through Paymattic, follow the steps with screenshots below â€“

First, go to **Payment Gatewa**y from the **Paymattic Navbar**, click the **Paystack** tab from the left sidebar, and the **Paystack Settings** page will open.

Select any **Payment Mode** between **Test** (for test payments) and **Live** ( for real payments) as both options follow the same configuration process, e.g., I choose the **Test Mode**.

Then, you need to obtain the **API key** and **Secret** key from your **Paystack Account**.

### Get the API key and Secret key from Paystack

First, log in to your [Paystack Account](https://dashboard.paystack.com/#/login). If you do not have an account, sign up from [here](https://dashboard.paystack.com/#/signup).

Once you log in to the **Paystack Dashboard**, go to the **Settings** section from the left sidebar, and click the **API Keys &amp; Webhooks** tab.

Now, copy the  **Secret key** and **Public key.**

Go back to **Payment Gatewa**y from the **Paymattic Navbar**, click the **Paystack** tab, and paste the copied **Public key** and **Secret key** into the **API key** and **Secret key** fields respectively.

Finally, press the **Save Settings** button and your Paystack account will be integrated with Paymattic for your WordPress Site.

## Add Paystack in Forms

Once you finish setting up your **Paystack** payment gateway, you can easily add this payment method to any of your existing [Payment Form](/how-to-create-your-first-payment-form-in-a-minute-and-accept-payments-with-paymattic).

If you do not have any existing forms, read[ Create a Form from Scratch](/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) or[ Create a Form using Templates](/simple-form-templates) documentation.

To learn the detailed process of adding a payment method to an existing form, read this [Documentation](/how-to-use-the-payment-method-fields-section).

But, remember, the added **Paystack** payment method in your **Form** will not function unless you complete the configuration process properly.
