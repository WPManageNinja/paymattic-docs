This detailed guide will walk you through the entire process of configuring SSLCOMMERZ on your WordPress site using the **Paymattic** plugin.

::: warning Prerequisites
Before we begin, it's important to note that access to the [SSLCOMMERZ](https://sslcommerz.com/) payment gateway is a premium feature.

## Configuring the SSLCOMMERZ Payment Method

Let's begin the one-time setup to connect your SSLCOMMERZ account with **Paymattic**. Once completed, SSLCOMMERZ will be available as a payment option in all your forms.

### Step 1: Navigate to the SSLCOMMERZ Settings

First, you need to find the specific configuration panel within your Paymattic dashboard.

1.  From your WordPress admin dashboard, hover over the **Paymattic** menu and click on **Payment Gateway**.
2.  On the Payment Gateway page, look at the list of gateways on the left and click on the **SSLCOMMERZ** tab.
3.  This will open the **SSLCOMMERZ Settings** page, where all the configuration will take place.

### Step 2: Choose Your Payment Mode

The first setting you need to configure is the payment mode. This determines whether you'll be processing real transactions or just testing your setup.

Select your **Payment Mode**:
-   **Test Mode**: This mode allows you to make test payments to ensure your forms are working correctly without involving real money. You'll need a Sandbox account from SSLCOMMERZ for this.
-   **Live Mode**: Select this when your site is ready to accept actual payments from customers.

For this guide, we will use **Test Mode**.

::: info Note
To proceed, you will need a **Store ID** and **Secret Key** from your **SSLCOMMERZ Account**, which we will cover in the next step.

### Step 3: Obtain Your Store ID & Secret Key

These credentials are what link your specific SSLCOMMERZ merchant account to Paymattic. The process for obtaining them differs slightly depending on whether you are a new or existing SSLCOMMERZ user.

#### For New Users

If you are new to SSLCOMMERZ, you'll need to create a merchant account first.

1.  Go to the [SSLCOMMERZ sign-up page](https://join.sslcommerz.com/) to open a new merchant account.

    ::: warning Important
    When filling out the sign-up form, it is crucial that you provide your valid:
    -   Email address
    -   Full name
    -   Complete address

    These fields are required by SSLCOMMERZ for proper payment data processing and to verify your identity.
    :::

2.  After successfully creating your account, SSLCOMMERZ will send you a welcome email. This email contains your vital credentials: the **Store ID** and **Secret Key**. Keep this email in a safe place.

2.  Carefully paste the credentials you received from SSLCOMMERZ into the appropriate fields:
