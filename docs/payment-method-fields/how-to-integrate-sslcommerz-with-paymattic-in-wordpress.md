SSLCOMMERZ is the largest Bangladesh-based payment gateway and aggregator that offers 30+ payment options including all types of debit cards, credit cards, prepaid cards, mobile banking, E-Wallets, and EMI. This article will guide you through configuring SSLCOMMERZ on your WordPress Site with the Paymattic plugin.

Remember, to get access to the [SSLCOMMERZ](https://sslcommerz.com/) payment gateway, you need the [Paymattic Pro Plugin](/# 1-toc-title).

## Configuring SSLCOMMERZ Payment Method 

To learn how to configure the SSLCOMMERZ payment gateway through Paymattic, follow the steps with screenshots below –

First, go to **Payment Gatewa**y from the **Paymattic Navbar**, click the **SSLCOMMERZ** tab from the left sidebar, and the **SSLCOMMERZ Settings** page will open.

Select any **Payment Mode** between **Test** (for test payments) and **Live** ( for real payments) as both options follow the same configuration process, e.g., I choose the **Test Mode**.

Then, you need to obtain the **Store ID** and **Secret** **Key** from your **SSLCOMMERZ** **Account**.

### Get the Store ID &amp; Secret Key from SSLCOMMERZ

To learn how to get the **Store ID** and **Secret key** from your [SSLCOMMERZ](https://sslcommerz.com/), follow the steps below –

First, open a merchant account with SSLCOMMERZ by clicking [here](https://join.sslcommerz.com/).
- *Remember**, you must add your **Email**, **Name**, and **Address** field on your **SSLCOMMERZ** **Signup Form** to get payment data correctly.
- *But**, if you already have an existing account, **contact** the **SSLCOMMERZ manager manually** through the official channel to get your Store ID and Store Password/Secret Key.

Once you open the account, you'll receive a welcome email with all your account details including **Store ID** and **Secret Key** similar to the screenshot below. Simply copy them.

## Add SSLCOMMERZ in Forms

Once you finish setting up your **SSLCOMMERZ** payment gateway, you can easily add this payment method to any of your existing [Payment Form](/how-to-create-your-first-payment-form-in-a-minute-and-accept-payments-with-paymattic).

If you do not have any existing forms, read[ Create a Form from Scratch](/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) or[ Create a Form using Templates](/simple-form-templates) documentation.

To learn the detailed process of adding a payment method to an existing form, read this [Documentation](/how-to-use-the-payment-method-fields-section).

But, remember, the added **SSLCOMMERZ** payment method in your **Form** will not function unless you complete the configuration process properly.
