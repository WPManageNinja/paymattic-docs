## Add PDF Feed in a Form

First, go to **All Forms** from the **Paymattic Navbar,** choose any existing **Form** you wish to work on, and click the **Pencil/Editor** icon.

If you do not have any existing forms, read these [Create a Form from Scratch](/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) or [Create a Form using Templates](/simple-form-templates) documentation.

For example, I choose the **PDF Form** to show the process.
