# How to Create WordPress Donation Form with Simple Form Templates?

[Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/) offers the simplest form templates. Not everyone needs extensive customization. Everything you would require when creating a form is already there. This article will guide you through creating a **Form using a Pre-built Template** to collect donation payments.

## Creating a Form with Templates


First, go to **Paymattic Dashboard** from the **WordPress Left Sidebar**, click the **Create Form** and you will get three options to create forms. These are:

- **Blank Form**: This option allows you to create fresh forms from scratch.
- **Choose Templates**: Here, you can use pre-built templates to create forms to avoid the hassle of making them from scratch.
- **Import From**: This option lets you import your JSON format forms from other platforms to Paymattic.

Click the **Choose Templates** tab to avoid creating a form from scratch.

Here, you will get all the **Pre-built Templates** Paymattic offers to make your form creation easier.

You can choose any template based on your needs by **entering the name in the search bar** or **browsing through the categories**. For example, I created a **Donation Form** to show you the whole process.

First, expand the **Donation** dropdown and choose one Category between **Simple Form** and **Advanced Form** as per your need. For example, I opened the **Advanced Form** category to choose templates.

After selecting the Template you want to use, click the **+ Create Form** button.

If you want to see the front-end view of your chosen template before starting the process, click the **Preview Form** button.

## Editing/Customizing the Template

Once you click the create form button it will redirect you to the form's **Editor** page where you can change the form's **Title** and add a **Description** by clicking on its name.

## Embedding the Form into Frontend

To embed and display the form on a specific Page/Post, **copy** this **Shortcode** and paste it into your desired Page/Post.

Once you complete the edit, press the **Save** button to save all the changes you made.
And, to see the **Preview** of the form, click the **Eye** icon.
