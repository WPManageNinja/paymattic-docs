In [Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/) you have the **Multiple Column Container** option to add multiple fields horizontally in one column instead of a new column for each field for your **Paymattic Forms** and make them look more compact and organized to your users.

This article will guide you on how to add the **Multiple Column Container** to your WordPress Site through Paymattic Forms.

## Adding Multiple Column Containers

To learn how to add the **Multiple Column Containers** in a Paymattic Form, follow the steps with the screenshots below –

Open your **Desired Form** where you wish to add the **Multiple Column Containers** feature.

If you do not have any existing forms, read [Create a Form from Scratch](/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) or [Create a Form using Templates](/simple-form-templates) documentation.

For example, I choose an existing form to show the whole process.

Once you open the **Editor** page, add the necessary fields by typing the **“ / ”** or clicking the **Plus Icon** placed at the bottom.

On the **Choose form field** page, you will see that **Two Types** of **Multiple Column Container** fields are available under the **General Fields** section. These are:
- **Two Column Container**: If you select this container, you will get two columns horizontally where you can add two different fields.
- **Three Column Container**: If you select this container, you will get three columns horizontally where you can add three different fields.

Both types of containers have the same functionality except for the number of added columns.

For example, I selected the **Three Column Container** to show the process.

## Customizing the Field

Here, you can see three columns are added!

Now, you can add three different fields horizontally inside these columns.
To add fields, click the **Plus Icon** of each column.

Once you click the Plus Icon, it will redirect you again to the **Choose form field** page where you will get all the field options that Paymattic offers.

Now, choose anyone according to your needs just by clicking on it.
But, we always suggest you keep the **[Name](/# 5-toc-title)** and **[Email](/# 6-toc-title)** field at the beginning of any Form.

Remember, almost every fields have a similar functionality. For example, I chose the [Name](/# 5-toc-title) field to show the process.

After adding the fields, you can **change the name** **of the fields** according to your preference by clicking the **Pencil/Edit** icon.

Also, you can see a **Black Box** with **three icon options** right **next** to the **Pencil** icon.
These are:
- **Trash Icon**: Use this, if you want to delete any fields anytime if needed.
- **Plus Icon**: Use this to add a new field right below. You can also use the **Plus Icon** placed at the bottom of the page.
- **Settings Icon**: Use this to **Edit** the field’s settings.

- **Required**: Enable this option to make this field mandatory to users for a successful submission.
- **Default Value**: You can set a value for this field using the **Shortcode** button or by entering a **Custom** **Value** to display default data in your form.

Once you set up all the settings, click the **Update** button to save all the customizations.
