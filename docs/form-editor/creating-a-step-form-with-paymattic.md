# How to Create a Step Form with Paymattic

In [Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/), you can easily create **Step Forms** i.e., to create multi-step forms that allow you to collect more data without scaring the users away. This article will guide you through Creating Step Forms.

## Creating a Step Form

To learn how to create Step Forms with Paymattic, follow the steps with the screenshots below â€“

First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Paymattic Navbar**, choose a **Form**, and click the **Pencil/Edit** icon to open the **Editor** page of that form.

::: tip
If you do not have any existing forms, read [Create a Form from Scratch](../form-editor/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic.md) or [Create a Form using Templates](../form-editor/simple-form-templates.md) documentation.
:::

For example, I choose an existing form to show the whole process.

Once you open the **Editor** page, add the necessary fields by typing the **" / "** or clicking the **Plus Icon** placed at the bottom.

## Customizing Step Form Field

Here, you can see the **Step Form** field is added with two steps.

You can **add** as many **steps** as you need by clicking the **Plus Icon** in the top right corner. Also, you can **provide** a **name** for each step by clicking the **Pencil Icon** right next to Step 1.

Now, under one specific step, you can add any field as per your need by typing "/" into the fields shown in the screenshot above.

To add more different field/s, click the **Plus Icon** placed at the bottom.

::: tip Best Practice
We always suggest you keep the **[Name](../general-input-fields/how-to-use-general-form-input-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic.md#_1-name)** and **[Email](../general-input-fields/how-to-use-general-form-input-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic.md#_2-email)** field at the beginning of any Form.

### Field Customization Options

After adding the fields, you can **change the name of the fields** by clicking the **Pencil** icon.

You can also adjust the settings of the fields with the help of **three icon options** in a **black box** in the right corner. These are:

1. **Trash Icon**: Use this if you want to delete any fields anytime if needed.
2. **Plus Icon**: Use this to add a new field right below. You can also use the **Plus Icon** placed at the bottom of the page.
3. **Settings Icon**: Use this to **Edit** the field's settings.

Once you complete Step 1, click **Next** to go to Step 2 and follow the same process to add your desired fields. You can also delete any steps by clicking the **Delete Step** button.

::: tip Note
Remember, almost every step has a similar functionality for adding and customizing field/s. For example, I chose the **[Name](../general-input-fields/how-to-use-general-form-input-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic.md#_1-name)** and **[Email](../general-input-fields/how-to-use-general-form-input-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic.md#_2-email)** field to show the process.

## Embedding the Form in Frontend

You can change the form's Title and Description by clicking on it.

Also, to embed and display the form on a specific Page/Post, **copy** this **Shortcode** and paste it into your desired Page/Post.

Once you complete the edit, press the **Save** button to save all the changes you made.
And, to see the **Preview** of the form, click the **Eye** icon.
