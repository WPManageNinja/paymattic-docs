In [Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/), you can easily create **Step Forms** i.e., to create multi-step forms that allow you to collect more data without scaring the users away. This article will guide you through Creating Step Forms.

## Creating a Step Form

To learn how to create Step Forms with Paymattic, follow the steps with the screenshots below –

First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Pymattic Navbar,** choose a **Form,** and click the **Pencil/Edit** icon to open the **Editor** page of that form.

If you do not have any existing forms, read [Create a Form from Scratch](/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) or [Create a Form using Templates](/simple-form-templates) documentation.

For example, I choose an existing form to show the whole process.

Once you open the **Editor** page, add the necessary fields by typing the **“ / ”** or clicking the **" + " Icon** placed at the bottom.

On the **Choose form field** page, you will get all the fields that Paymattic offers.

Remember, to create a Step Form, you must add the **Step Form** field.

## Customizing Step Form Field

Here, you can see the **Step Form** field is added with two steps.

You can **add** as many **steps** as you need by clicking the **Plus Icon** in the top right corner. Also, you can **provide** a **name** for each step by clicking the **Pencil** **Icon** right next to Step 1.

Now, under one specific step, you can any field as per your need by typing "/" into the fields shown in the screenshot above.

To add more different field/s, click the **Plus Icon** placed at the bottom.

We always suggest you keep the **[Name](/# 5-toc-title)** and **[Email](/# 6-toc-title)** field at the beginning of any Form.

After adding the fields, you can **change the name** **of the fields** by clicking the **Pencil** icon.

You can also adjust the settings of the fields with the help of **three icon options** in a **black box** in the right corner. These are:
- **Trash Icon**: Use this if you want to delete any fields anytime if needed.
- **Plus Icon**: Use this to add a new field right below. You can also use the **Plus Icon** placed at the bottom of the page.
- **Settings Icon**: Use this to **Edit** the field’s settings.

Once you complete Step 1, click **Next** to go to Step 2 and follow the same process to add your desired fields. You can also delete any steps by clicking the **Delete Step** button.

Remember, almost every step has a similar functionality for adding and customizing field/s. For example, I chose the **[Name](/# 5-toc-title)** and **Email** field to show the process.

## Embedding the Form in Frontend

You can change the form’s Title and Description by clicking on it.

Also, to embed and display the form on a specific Page/Post, **copy** this **Shortcode** and paste it into your desired Page/Post.

Once you complete the edit, press the **Save** button to save all the changes you made.
And, to see the **Preview** of the form, click the **Eye** icon.
