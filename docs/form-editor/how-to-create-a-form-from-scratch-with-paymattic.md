# Create a Form from Scratch with Paymattic

This article will guide you through the process of how you can easily **Create a Form** from scratch through [Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/).

## Creating a Form from Scratch

To learn how to create a form from scratch with Paymattic, follow the steps with the screenshots below â€“

First, go to the **Paymattic Dashboard** from the **WordPress Left Sidebar** and click the **Create Form** section. Then, you will get three options to create forms. These are:

- **Blank Form**: This option allows you to create fresh forms from scratch.
- **Choose Templates**: Here, you can use pre-built templates to create forms to avoid the hassle of making them from scratch.
- **Import From**: This option lets you import your JSON format forms from other platforms to Paymattic.

To create a form from scratch, click the **Blank Form** option.

## Adding Desired Field/s

Once you click the **Blank form**, it will redirect you to the **Editor** page where you can build your form by adding necessary fields and edit it anytime if needed.

Here, you will have **Two Options** for adding your **Desired Fields** to the form. These are:

1. **Type "/" to insert fields**: In this field, you can easily add your desired field/s by typing the field name with the "/" sign before it.

2. **Plus Icon**: You can simply click the **+ Plus Icon** and all the available fields will appear inside a pop-up page from where you can choose your desired field/s.

For instance, I clicked the **Plus Icon** to add the Payment related fields.
