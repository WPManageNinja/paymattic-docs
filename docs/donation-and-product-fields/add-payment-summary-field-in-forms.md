# Add Payment Summary Field in Forms 

In [Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/), the **Payment Summary** field allows users to view a summary of their total payments based on the selected items or products and you can use it in any [Payment Form](/form-editor/how-to-create-your-first-payment-form-in-a-minute-and-accept-payments-with-paymattic).

This article will guide you on how to embed the **Payment Summary** field to the WordPress Site through Paymattic.  

## Adding Payment Summary Field

To learn how to add the **Payment Summary** field to the Paymattic Form on your WordPress site, follow the steps with the screenshots below –  

First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Paymattic Navbar,** choose a **Form,** and click the **Pencil/Edit** icon to open the **Editor** page of that form.

::: tip
If you do not have any existing forms, read this [Create a Form from Scratch](/form-editor/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) or [Create a Form using Templates](/form-editor/simple-form-templates) documentation to create one.
:::

For example, I choose an existing form to show the whole process.

Once you open the **Editor** page, add the **Payment Summary** fields by typing the **"/"** or clicking the **Plus Icon** placed at the bottom.

::: tip
We always suggest you keep the [**Name**](/general-input-fields/how-to-use-general-form-input-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic#name-field) and [**Email**](/general-input-fields/how-to-use-general-form-input-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic#email-field) field at the beginning of any Form.

For example, I choose the **Plus Icon** option to select the **Payment Summary** field under the **Donation & Product Fields** section from the **Choose Form Field** page.

::: tip
Also, don't forget to add a [Payment Item Field](/donation-and-product-fields/how-to-add-payment-item-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic) for making the **Payment Summary** field functional and a [Payment Method Field](/general-input-fields/how-to-use-the-payment-method-fields-section) for collecting payments.

::: tip
You can edit their field name and settings. To learn more about form editing, read this [Documentation](/form-editor/how-to-edit-forms-in-wordpress-with-paymattic).

Now, a pop-up page will appear with various settings options for customizing the field. 

### General Settings 

All the Settings under the General Tab mentioned in the below screenshot are briefly explained:

- **Default Error Message**: Generally, if your form doesn't have any **Payment Item** field, the **Payment Summary** field will not work and an error message will be displayed to your users. In this case, you can set what you want to show in your error message by default.

Once you finish, click the **Update** button to save all your configuration.
