## Adding Tax Calculated Amount Field

To learn how to add the **Tax Calculated Amount** to the Paymattic Form on your WordPress site, follow the steps with the screenshots below â€“  

First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Pymattic Navbar,** choose a **Form,** and click the **Pencil/Edit** icon to open the **Editor** page of that form.

::: tip
If you do not have any existing forms, read this [Create a Form from Scratch](./how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic.md) or [Create a Form using Templates](./simple-form-templates.md) documentation to create one.
:::

For example, I choose an existing form to show the whole process.
