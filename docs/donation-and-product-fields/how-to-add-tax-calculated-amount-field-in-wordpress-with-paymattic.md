- *Tax Calculated Amount** is a premium feature and you need the [**Paymattic Pro Plugin**](/how-to-install-and-activate-paymattic-in-wordpress) to use this field**.**

## Adding Tax Calculated Amount Field

To learn how to add the **Tax Calculated Amount** to the Paymattic Form on your WordPress site, follow the steps with the screenshots below –

First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Pymattic Navbar,** choose a **Form,** and click the **Pencil/Edit** icon to open the **Editor** page of that form.

If you do not have any existing forms, read this [Create a Form from Scratch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tg7v6UFVUGX1UNwyztziuV4Al9srPSOnjO2aSiq0BDI/edit) or [Create a Form using Templates](/simple-form-templates) documentation to create one.

For example, I choose an existing form to show the whole process.

Once you open the **Editor** page, add the **Tax Calculated Amount** field by typing the **“ / ”** or clicking the **Plus Icon** placed at the bottom.

We always suggest you keep the [**Name**](/# 5-toc-title) and [**Email**](/# 6-toc-title) field at the beginning of any Form.

For example, I choose the **Pluc Icon** option to select the **Tax Calculated Amount** field under the **Donation &amp; Product Fields** section from the **Choose Form Field** page.

Also, don’t forget to add a [**Payment Item** **Field**](/how-to-add-payment-item-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic) for making the **Tax Calculated Amount** field functional and a [**Payment Method Field**](/how-to-use-the-payment-method-fields-section) for collecting payments.
