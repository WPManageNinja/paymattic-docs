### General Settings


This guide explains the settings found under the **General** Tab for the **Tax Calculated Amount** field. This field is used to apply a percentage-based tax to a specific payment item in your form.

[Screenshot of the General Tab settings for the Tax Calculated Amount field.]

#### Tax Percentage
Here, you can set the tax rate that will be applied. Enter the percentage as a number without the percent sign (for example, enter `8` for an 8% tax).

#### Target Product Item
From this dropdown menu, you must select the **Payment Item** field to which this tax will apply. The calculation will be based on the amount of the selected product.


* **Important Note:** Remember to use a separate **Tax Calculated Amount** field for each **Payment Item** field that requires tax. One tax field can only target one payment item.

Once you finish, click the **Update** button at the top of the form editor to save all your configurations.

### Advanced Settings

Once you complete the **General** settings for your field, you can go to the **Advanced** tab to find more technical options.

#### Admin Label
This label is for internal use only. The text you enter here will be used as the fieldâ€™s label in the admin backend (for example, on the **Entries** page). It will not be visible to the public, making it useful for adding notes or clarifying a field's purpose for your team.

#### Field Wrapper CSS Class
This is used for adding a custom CSS class to the entire field container (the wrapper). This allows you to apply unique styling like borders, margins, or background colors to the whole field element.

* **Note:** To learn more, see our guide on applying [**Custom CSS**](/form-settings/how-to-create-custom-css-js-in-wordpress-with-paymattic) to forms.

#### Input Elements CSS Class
This is used for adding a custom CSS class specifically to the `<input>` element itself. Use this to control the font, color, or other styles of the input box where data is entered or displayed.


#### Field ID
This option displays the unique ID assigned to the form field. It is primarily used for custom development, such as targeting the field with custom JavaScript or for integration purposes.
