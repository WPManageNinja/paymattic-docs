## Adding Custom Payment Amount Field

First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Pymattic Navbar,** choose a **Form,** and click the **Pencil/Edit** icon to open the **Editor** page of that form.

If you do not have any existing form, read this [Create a Form from Scratch](./how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic.md) or [Create a Form using Templates](./simple-form-templates.md) documentation to create one. **For example**, I choose an existing form to show the whole process.
