# How to Add Subscription Payment Item Fields in Paymattic?

In [Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/), the **Subscription Payment** field allows you to create forms with **Subscription Items** for collecting **Recurring Payments.** This article will guide you on how to embed the Subscription Payment field to the WordPress Site through Paymattic.

::: warning
**Subscription Payment** is a premium feature and you need [**Paymattic Pro Plugin**](../getting-started-with-paymattic/how-to-install-and-activate-paymattic-in-wordpress#installing-and-activating-paymattic-pro) **to use this field.**
:::

## Adding Subscription Payment Field


First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Paymattic Navbar,** choose a **Form,** and click the **Pencil/Edit** icon to open the **Editor** page of that form.

For example, I choose an existing form to show the whole process.

![Open desired form](/images/donation-and-product-fields/how-to-add-susbcription-payment-item-fields-in-paymattic/1.-Open-desired-form-1-scaled.webp)

Once you open the **Editor** page, add the Payment Item fields by typing the **"/"** or clicking the **Plus Icon** placed at the bottom.

::: tip Best Practice
We always suggest you keep the [**Name**](/general-input-fields/how-to-use-general-form-input-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic#_1-name-field) and [**Email**](/general-input-fields/how-to-use-general-form-input-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic#_2-email-field) field at the beginning of any Form.
:::

![Type / or click + icon](/images/donation-and-product-fields/how-to-add-susbcription-payment-item-fields-in-paymattic/2.-Type-or-click-icon-1.webp)

For example, I choose the **Plus Icon** option to select the **Subscription Payment** field under the **Donation & Product Fields** section from the **Choose Form Field** page.

::: tip
Also, do not forget to add a [**Payment Method Field**](/general-input-fields/how-to-use-the-payment-method-fields-section) for collecting payments.

## Editing/Customizing the Field

::: tip
You can edit their field name and settings. To learn more about form editing, read this [Documentation](/form-editor/how-to-edit-forms-in-wordpress-with-paymattic).

Specifically, to edit the **Subscription Payment** field according to your needs, click the **Settings Icon** from the right-side corner.

Now, a pop-up page will appear with various settings options for customizing the field.
