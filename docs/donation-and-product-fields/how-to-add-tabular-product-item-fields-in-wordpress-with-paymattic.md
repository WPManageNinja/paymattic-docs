In [Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/), the Tabular Product Items field lets you display products neatly on your website in a Table, Grid, or Single Line format, making it easy for customers to view their products. This article will guide you on how to add the Tabular Product Items field to the WordPress Site through Paymattic.

::: warning Pro Feature
**Tabular Product Items** is a premium feature and you need the [**Paymattic Pro Plugin**](/getting-started-with-paymattic/how-to-install-and-activate-paymattic-in-wordpress) to use this field.
:::

Additionally, with the **Grid Template** and **Single Line Template**, you can build the **Shopping Cart/s** to showcase your products in your forms.

## Adding Tabular Product Items


First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Paymattic Navbar,** choose a **Form,** and click the **Pencil/Edit** icon to open the **Editor** page of that form.

For example, here we choose an existing form to show the whole process.

Once you open the **Editor** page, add the Tabular Product Items fields by typing the **" / "** or clicking the **" + " icon** placed at the bottom.

::: tip Best Practice
We always suggest you keep the [Name Field](/general-input-fields/how-to-use-general-form-input-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic#_1-name-field) and [Email Field](/general-input-fields/how-to-use-general-form-input-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic#_2-email-field) at the beginning of any Form.

All the Settings under the General Tab for Grid Template are briefly explained below:

#### B. Manage Product Settings

This option allows you to customize the design of the product table based on your preferences using the following options:
- **Disable Product**: Enable this toggle if you want to just simply disable this specific product from showcasing in your form instead of deleting it.
- **Delete Product**: If you want to delete any existing products, click this button.
- **Add Product**: To add as many products as you need, click this **Add Product** button in the left sidebar.
- **Product Details**: Here, you will get all the settings to customize your product details.
- **Provide Value & Extra Price Separately**: You can set different prices for the same product based on specific criteria to create product variations in your form.

With drag and drop icon, you can organize the rows smoothly with less time and effort. Also, you can **add multiple extra prices** by clicking the **+ Add More** button and **delete** anytime by clicking the **Trash Icon** if needed. Plus, to set multiple criteria for setting the extra price, click the **+Add More Options** button.

For example, if you have a clothing item with a base price of $100, but you wish to add separately an extra $50 for a Large size on that same product, you can use this setting.

#### C. Show Subtotal

If the option is enabled, users can view the subtotal amount below the table.

### Single Line Template's General Settings

The **Single Line** template has the same settings as the **Grid Template**. The difference is that it showcases each product in a single line and displays all products vertically one by one.

Here is the preview of the added Single Line template of the tabular product field in the form Editor.
