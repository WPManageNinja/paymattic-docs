- *Donation Progress Item** is a free feature except for the **Recurring Amount** and **Custom Amount** option and to use these two options in your field, you need [**Paymattic Pro Plugin**](/# 1-toc-title)**.**

## Adding Donation Progress Item Field

To learn how to add the Donation Progress Item to the Paymattic Donation Form on your WordPress site, follow the steps with the screenshots below –

First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Pymattic Navbar,** choose a **Form,** and click the **Pencil/Edit** icon to open the **Editor** page of that form.

If you do not have any existing forms, read this [Create a Form from Scratch](/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) or [Create a Form using Templates](/simple-form-templates) documentation to create one.

For example, I choose an existing form to show the whole process.

Once you open the **Editor** page, add the Donation Progress Item fields by typing the **“ / ”** or clicking the **Plus Icon** placed at the bottom.
- *Remember**, we always suggest you keep the [Name](/# 5-toc-title) and [Email](/# 6-toc-title) field at the beginning of any Form.
