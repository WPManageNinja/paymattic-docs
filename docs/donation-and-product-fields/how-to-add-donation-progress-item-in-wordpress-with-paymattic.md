### General Settings


This guide explains the options available in the **General** tab for the Donation field, which allows you to configure a flexible and powerful fundraising form.

[Screenshot of the General tab settings for the Donation field.]

#### Required
Enable this toggle to make the donation field mandatory. Users will be required to select or enter a donation amount to submit the form.

#### Enable Image
Toggle this option on to display an image within the donation field, such as a campaign photo.
* To add your image, click the **Plus Icon** under the **Upload Image** section.

#### Statistics
Enable this to display fundraising goals and progress on your form.
* **Goal amount:** Set the total monetary goal for your campaign.
* **Show a progress bar:** Check this box to display a visual progress bar tracking donations. You can uncheck the **Progress Bar** box if you prefer not to display it.

#### Initial Raising Amount
Enter a starting value for your campaign here. This amount will be counted toward your goal from the beginning (e.g., for funds raised offline).

#### Predefined donation amounts
Here, you can create a list of suggested, fixed-price donation amounts (e.g., $10, $25, $50). This provides donors with quick and easy options.

#### Allow custom amount
> **Note:** This is a Paymattic Pro feature.

Check this option to allow donors to enter a custom amount they wish to contribute, in addition to or instead of the predefined amounts.

#### Default donation amount
From your list of **Predefined donation amounts**, you can select one to be highlighted as the default or recommended option when the form first loads.

#### Collect Recurring Donations
> **Note:** This is a Paymattic Pro feature.

Check the **Allow Recurring Amount** option to give donors the choice to make their contribution a recurring subscription. The following settings are available:
* **Maximum billing time:** Limit the total number of times a donor will be billed.
* **Billing intervals:** Set the recurring frequency, such as **daily**, **weekly**, **fortnightly**, **monthly**, **quarterly**, **half-yearly**, or **yearly**.
* **Display Options:** Customize how the recurring choices are presented to the donor.

### Advanced Settings

Once you complete the **General** settings, go to the **Advanced** tab to find more technical options for your **Donation Progress Item** field.

### Admin Label
This label is for internal use only. The text you enter here will be used as the field’s label in the admin backend (for example, on the **Entries** page). It will not be visible to the public, making it useful for clarifying a field's purpose for your team.

#### Field Wrapper CSS Class
This is used for adding a custom CSS class to the entire field container (the wrapper). This allows you to apply unique styling like borders, margins, or background colors to the whole progress bar element.

* **Note:** To learn more, see our guide on applying [**Custom CSS**](/form-settings/how-to-create-custom-css-js-in-wordpress-with-paymattic) to forms.

#### Conditional Render
You can set conditional logic to show or hide the donation progress display. This feature can be triggered by specific actions a user takes in a previous input field.

* **Note:** For a detailed guide on this feature, please read our documentation on [**Conditional Logic**](/form-editor/how-to-use-conditional-logic-in-form-fields-with-paymattic).

#### Field ID
This option displays the unique ID assigned to the form field. It is primarily used for custom development, such as targeting the field with custom JavaScript or for integration purposes.

Once you finish, click the **Update** button to save all your configurations.

## Embedding the Form

Once your fields are configured, you will see the **Donation Progress Item** with its **Progress Bar** in the form editor. Before you publish, here are the final steps to get your form ready.

#### Important Reminders

* **Edit Title & Description:** You can change the form’s **Title** and **Description** at any time by simply clicking on the text in the editor.
* **Add a Payment Method:** A form cannot collect payments without a **Payment Method** field. Make sure you have added and configured at least one.

#### Saving and Displaying the Form

1.  **Save Your Form**
    After you finish editing, press the **Save** button at the top-right corner to save all the changes you made.

2.  **Preview the Form**
    To see what your form will look like to visitors, click the **Preview** button (the **Eye** icon).

3.  **Copy the Shortcode**
    To display the form on your website, copy the **Shortcode** from the top of the editor. It will look like this: `[paymattic_form id="123"]`.

4.  **Embed in a Page/Post**
    Paste the copied **Shortcode** into the content area of your desired WordPress page or post.

Once you publish the page, your donation form will be live and ready to help you achieve your fundraising goals.
