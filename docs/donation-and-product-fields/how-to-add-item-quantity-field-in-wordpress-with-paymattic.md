## Adding Item Quantity Field

To learn how to add the Item Quantity to the Paymattic Form on your WordPress site, follow the steps with the screenshots below –

First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Paymattic Navbar,** choose a **Form,** and click the **Pencil/Edit** icon to open the **Editor** page of that form.

::: tip
If you do not have any existing forms, read this [Create a Form from Scratch](/form-editor/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) or [Create a Form using Templates](/form-editor/simple-form-templates) documentation to create one.
:::

For example, I choose an existing form to show the whole process.

Once you open the **Editor** page, add the Payment Item fields by typing the **"/"** or clicking the **Plus Icon** placed at the bottom.

::: tip Best Practice
We always suggest you keep the [**Name**](/general-input-fields/how-to-use-general-form-input-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic#_1-name-field) and [**Email**](/general-input-fields/how-to-use-general-form-input-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic#_2-email-field) field at the beginning of any Form.
:::

For example, I choose the **Plus Icon** option to select the **Item Quantity** field under the **Donation & Product Fields** section from the **Choose Form Field** page.

::: warning
Also, don't forget to add a [Payment Item Field](/donation-and-product-fields/how-to-add-payment-item-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic) for selecting the **Item Quantity** and a [Payment Method Field](/general-input-fields/how-to-use-the-payment-method-fields-section) for collecting payments. Plus, to see the quantities in a clear view, we recommend adding the [Payment Summary](/donation-and-product-fields/add-payment-summary-field-in-forms) field.
