[Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/) integrates with [Google reCAPTCHA](https://paymattic.com/configure-google-recaptcha-for-your-website-security/#what-is-google-recaptcha) to protect your WordPress forms from spam and automated submissions. This guide walks you through setting up reCAPTCHA in Paymattic.

## Get the reCAPTCHA API Keys

Before configuring reCAPTCHA in Paymattic, you must get your API keys from Google reCAPTCHA.
To learn how to get the reCAPTCHA Site and Secret keys, follow the steps with the screenshots below – 

First, go to the [Google reCaptcha Site](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create), and click the Plus Icon.

Now, put a **Name** into the **Label** field to identify your website in the future and choose the **reCAPTCHA type** you prefer (v2 or v3) e.g., I choose V3. 

Then, enter your website/s address in the **Domains** field to register your domain for a reCAPTCHA verification. Also, you can choose your project from the **Google Cloud Platform** dropdown.

Once you provide all the necessary information, click the **Submit** button and you will get your desired Site key and Secret key.

Also, you can change the existing owner’s email address or add an admin email to manage reCAPTCHA in the **Owners** field. Plus, you can set the security preference according to your needs.

Finally, click the **Save** button and all your changes will be saved.

## Configuring reCAPTCHA

To learn how to configure reCAPTCHA with Paymattic, follow the steps with the screenshots below – 

First, go to **Settings** from the **Paymattic Navbar**, click the **reCAPTCHA** tab from the left sidebar, and three options appear. These are: 

* **Disable reCAPTCHA:** You can use this option if you don’t want to enable reCAPTCHA. This option will be selected by default.
* **Visible reCAPTCHA (V2):** This requires users to check a box indicating they are not a robot i.e., it verifies the request with a challenge.
* **Invisible reCAPTCHA (V3):** Operates in the background and scores the user’s interaction to determine if they are a bot i.e., it verifies the request a score.
