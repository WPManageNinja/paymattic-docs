# Manage User Roles

[Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/) allows you to assign and manage user roles within WordPress, providing flexibility in controlling user access and permissions based on payments or subscriptions. This article will guide you on how to manage user roles efficiently using Paymattic.

> By default, only WordPress Administrators have full access to all forms and features.

## Managing User Roles

To learn how to assign or modify the **User Roles** through Paymattic, follow the steps with the screenshots below – 

First, go to go to **Settings** from the Paymattic Navbar, click the **Permission** tab from the left sidebar, and all the user roles will appear.

Now, **select the roles** by clicking the **checkbox** you want to give access to your users.
For example, I selected the Author, Contributor, Tutor Instructor, and Support Agent roles.

Also, if you want to select all the roles at once, simply click the **Check All** button.
Once you select the roles, press the **Save Settings** button to save all the changes.
