## Configuration Options

### User Permissions

The Paymattic User option allows you to choose the level of access you want to give your users. 

Now, select the roles by clicking the **checkbox** according to your preference. For example, I selected the **Read entry** roles.

But, if you want to select all the roles at once, simply click the **Check All** button.

Remember, if you want your users to be able to cancel their subscriptions from their user dashboard, make sure to check the “Cancel Subscription” box.

## User Registration Setup

You will need a User Registration Form for your user to register in your Paymattic Dashboard. 

### Create Registration Form

First, go to **All Forms** from the Paymattic Navbar, choose any existing User Registration Form you have, and click the **Pencil/Editor** icon.

For example, I choose the **Registration Form for the Paymattic Dashboard** to show the process.

If you do not have any existing forms, read the [create a from scratch](/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) or Create a Form using [using templates](/simple-form-templates) documentation.

Click the **Configure Modules** button and it will redirect you to the **Integration** section from Paymattic Navbar.

All the settings options mentioned in the screenshot below are briefly explained:

* **Name:** Here, you can set a name according to your preference for your feed.
* **Email Address:** In this field, you have to select the Email Address.
* **User Name:** Here, use the {input.customer_email} shortcode because your customer email will be the user name to log in to your Paymattic user dashboard field.
* **Full Name:** Here,  use the {input.customer_name} shortcode
* **Password:** Here, use the {input.password} shortcode to address your password
* **Default User Role:** You can select a default user role for your paymattic user.
* **User Meta:** Here, you can add some User Meta Key and Meta Value if needed.
* **Allow the user login automatically after registration:** Enable this option and your user will be directly logged into your Paymattic User Dashboard after registration.
* **Send default WordPress welcome email to user after registration:** Here you will also get the checkbox option to give a Welcome Email Notification to your user.
Don’t create a user if one already exists in the database with the same email address: If you want to disable the form submission of already existing users then just simply check this box.
* **Conditional logics:** If you have any conditions about this submission just set the conditions from the Conditional Logic option. 
* **Enable this field:** If you check this option, all the actions of this feed will only run for the visitors who are in logged out state and the email that is not registered yet.

Once you set up the page, click the Create User Registration Feed button and the feed will be added.

Also, to display the payment receipt to your user, you can use this **[wppayform_receipt]** shortcode to the Paymattic Dashboard page.

Finally, click on the **Save Confirmations Settings** to save your changes. 

:::tip Display Payment Receipt

## Display the Dashboard

To display your User Dashboard through the **User Registration Form** to the front end of your desired WordPress Site, follow the steps with the screenshots below – 

First, go to the **All Forms** from the Paymattic Navbar and copy the **Shortcode** of your User Registration Form.

![Copy shortcode](/images/global-settings/how-to-add-user-dashboard-module-in-paymattic/Copy-the-chortcode-of-the-desired-form-scaled.webp)
