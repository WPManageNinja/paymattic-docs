## Managing User Roles

To learn how to assign or modify the **User Roles** through Paymattic, follow the steps with the screenshots below â€“ 

First, go to go to **Settings** from the Paymattic Navbar, click the **Permission** tab from the left sidebar, and all the user roles will appear.

Now, **select the roles** by clicking the **checkbox** you want to give access to your users.
For example, I selected the Author, Contributor, Tutor Instructor, and Support Agent roles.

Also, if you want to select all the roles at once, simply click the **Check All** button.
Once you select the roles, press the **Save Settings** button to save all the changes.
