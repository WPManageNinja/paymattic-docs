[Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/) allows you to set up the currency for your payment gateways, for local or global use, and change the existing currency settings for an individual Paymattic Form. This article will guide you through setting up the currency settings for all payment gateways or changing the existing currency settings for a specific Paymattic Form.

## Currency Settings Globally for All Forms

To learn how to set the Currency Settings for your payment gateways, follow the steps with the screenshots below –

First, go to **Settings** from the **Paymattic Navbar**, click the **General Settings** tab from the left sidebar, and four major settings sections will appear. These are:
- Currency Settings
- Currency Switcher Settings
- Honeypot Security
- Other Settings

Remember, these Settings will function generally for all Paymattic Forms except the Currency Switcher as this feature works only in Donation Form. To learn how to create a Donation Form, read this [Documentation](/simple-form-templates).

Once you are done with the customization, press the **Save Settings** button and all your changes will be saved.

- *All the setting options mentioned above are briefly explained below:**

### Currency Settings

This setting will help you to set up your currency type and how you want to display the currency on your payment collection forms for your payment gateways.
- **Currency**: Here, you can set the currency type from the dropdown list according to your requirements, e.g., I choose the **United States Dollar**.
- **Currency Sign Position**: Here, you can set the currency sign position according to your requirements by clicking the checkbox, e.g., I choose the **Right (100$)** option.
- **Currency Seperator**: Here, you will get two types of currency separators from the dropdown list. Choose anyone according to your needs.
- **Hide decimal points for rounded numbers**: Check this box if you don’t want decimal points if the currency figure is rounded.

Remember, this Currency Settings will function generally for all Paymattic Forms.

Remember, this Currency Settings will function only for all Paymattic’s [Donation Forms](/simple-form-templates).

### Honeypot Security 

Honeypot is a clever cybersecurity strategy that acts like a digital decoy, designed to lure cybercriminals into a trap and keep them away from legitimate targets. Enable this setting if you want Paymattic to verify honeypot security for all Paymattic Forms.

To learn about Honeypot Security in detail, read this [Article](https://paymattic.com/honeypot-in-cyber-security/#what-is-honeypot-security).

### Other Settings

Here you will find three more settings. These are:
- **Stripe Checkout Locale**: This is used to determine the language displayed on the checkout page for your Stripe Users (i.e., setting the locale to Dutch will show the Stripe Checkout page in Dutch). We recommend selecting the Auto-detect locale to automatically detect the user's language based on their locality.
- **Submission Abandoned After**: Here, you can set the duration for a form’s submission/entry to include in the abandoned list. For example, if a form entry has a "pending" payment status for 3 hours, it will be added to the abandoned list while still showing as pending. You can view the abandoned entries in the list.
- **Disable IP Address Logging**: If you disable this option, the IP addresses of your users will not be tracked by your site anymore.

To learn how you can change the currency settings for an individual form, follow the steps with screenshots below –

First, go to the **All Forms** from the **Paymattic Navbar,** choose the form you wish to work on, and click the **Pencil/Editor** icon.
