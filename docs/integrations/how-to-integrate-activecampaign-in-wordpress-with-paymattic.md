[Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/) integrates [ActiveCampaign](https://www.activecampaign.com/) a marketing automation tool that helps you to collect customer information, and automatically adds it to your ActiveCampaign list. This article will guide you through integrating **ActiveCampaign** with **Paymattic** on your **WordPress Site**.

ActiveCampaign is the Premium Feature of the Paymattic Plugin. So, you need Paymattic Pro to integrate this.
