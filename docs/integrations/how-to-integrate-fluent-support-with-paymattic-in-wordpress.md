[Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/) allows you to connect with [Fluent Support](https://fluentsupport.com/), a WordPress plugin, to enable paid customer support tickets. This article will guide you through integrating **Fluent Support** in your **WordPress** **Site** with **Paymattic**.

## Enable Fluent Support Integration

To learn how to enable Fluent Support integration, follow the steps with screenshots below –

First, go to **Integrations** from the **Paymattic Navbar**, search for **Fluent Support** through the search bar, and you will get the **Fluent Support** integration module.

Before starting the process, ensure you **Installed** and **Activated** the **Fluent Support Plugin** in your WordPress Site.

Learn how to install and activate the [Fluent Support Free](https://fluentsupport.com/docs/how-to-install-activate-fluent-support/) or [Fluent Support Pro](https://fluentsupport.com/docs/upgrade-to-fluent-support-pro-add-on/) version.

## Integrate Fluent Support into Paymattic Forms

To learn how to integrate Fluent Support into any specific Form in Paymattic, follow the steps with the screenshots below –

First, go to **All Forms** from the **Paymattic Navbar**, **select** the **Desired Form** where you want to integrate **Fluent Support,** and click the **Pencil/Editor Icon.**

Now, a pop-up page will appear with various settings options for configuring Fluent Support.
- *All the settings options mentioned in the screenshot below are briefly explained:**
- **Feed Name**: Here, you can set a name according to your preference for your feed. This field is required to be filled in.
- **Primary Fields**: Use all the fields under this option to properly link your Fluent Support Fields with the Form Fields. Also, you can easily select the **Value** for the **Form Fields** according to the **Fluent Support Fields** by using the **Shortcode** button.
- **Create Ticket on Payment Success Only**: If you enable this option, the ticket will be generated only after successful payment is received, i.e., creating the support ticket as soon as the form is submitted with a successful payment. But if you do not enable this option, it will instantly create the ticket without checking the payment status.
- **Conditional Logics**: This option allows Fluent Support integration to function conditionally based on your submission values according to your set conditional logic/s. Also, here, you can add as much conditional logic as you need by clicking the **+ Add More** button and delete any logic by clicking the **Trash Icon** if needed. To learn more, read this [Documentation](/how-to-use-conditional-logic-in-form-fields-with-paymattic).
- **Enable This Feed**: Check this option, to ensure this integration feed remains enabled, and all the actions of this feed function properly.

Once the setup is done, finally, click the **Create Fluent Support Feed** button.
And, your Fluent Support will be integrated into this specific form!

After successful Integration, now you will see that your **Fluent Support Integration Feed** has been added here.

You can modify your feed anytime by clicking the **Pencil Icon** and delete it by clicking the **Trash Icon**.
Also, you can disable or enable this feed anytime by clicking the **Toggl**e button if needed.
