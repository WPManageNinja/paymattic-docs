# Integrate Fluent Support with Paymattic

[Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/) allows you to connect with [Fluent Support](https://fluentsupport.com/), a WordPress plugin, to enable paid customer support tickets. This article will guide you through integrating Fluent Support in your **WordPress** Site with **Paymattic**.

## Enable Fluent Support Integration


First, go to **Integrations** from the **Paymattic Navbar**, search for **Fluent Support** through the search bar, and you will get the **Fluent Support** integration module.

Before starting the process, ensure you **Installed** and **Activated** the **Fluent Support Plugin** in your WordPress Site.

## Integrate Fluent Support into Paymattic Forms


First, go to **All Forms** from the **Paymattic Navbar**, select the **Desired Form** where you want to integrate Fluent Support, and click the **Pencil/Editor** Icon.

Now, a pop-up page will appear with various settings options for configuring Fluent Support. 

**All the settings options mentioned in the screenshot below are briefly explained:**

* **Feed Name:** Here, you can set a name according to your preference for your feed. This field is required to be filled in.
* **Primary Fields:** Use all the fields under this option to properly link your Fluent Support Fields with the Form Fields. Also, you can easily select the **Value** for the **Form Fields** according to the Fluent Support Fields by using the **Shortcode** button. 
* **Create Ticket on Payment Success Only:** If you enable this option, the ticket will be generated only after successful payment is received, i.e., creating the support ticket as soon as the form is submitted with a successful payment. But if you do not enable this option, it will instantly create the ticket without checking the payment status.
* **Conditional Logics:** This option allows Fluent Support integration to function conditionally based on your submission values according to your set conditional logic/s.  Also, here,  you can add as much conditional logic as you need by clicking the **+ Add More** button and delete any logic by clicking the **Trash** Icon if needed. To learn more, read our [conditional logic documentation](/use-conditional-logic).

Once the setup is done, finally, click the **Create Fluent Support Feed** button. And, your Fluent Support will be integrated into this specific form!

After successful Integration, now you will see that your **Fluent Support Integration Feed** has been added here.

You can modify your feed anytime by clicking the **Pencil Icon** and delete it by clicking the **Trash Icon**.
Also, you can disable or enable this feed anytime by clicking the **Toggle** button if needed.
