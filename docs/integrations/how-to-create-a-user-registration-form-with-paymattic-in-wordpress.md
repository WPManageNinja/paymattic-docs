* **Email Address:** In this field, you have to select the **Email Address**.
* **User Name:** Here, you can set the `{input.customer_email}` shortcode by clicking the Shortcode Icon because your customer email will be the user name to log in to your Paymattic user dashboard field.

* **Send default WordPress welcome email to user after registration:** Here you will also get the checkbox option to give a Welcome Email Notification to your user.
* **Don’t create a user if one already exists in the database with the same email address:** If you want to disable the form submission of already existing users then just simply check this box.
* **Conditional logics:** If you have any conditions about this submission just set the conditions from the Conditional Logic option. To learn more, read our [conditional logic guide](/how-to-use-conditional-logic-in-form-fields-with-paymattic).
* **Enable this field:** If you check this option, all the actions of this feed will only run for the visitors who are in a logged-out state and the email that is not registered yet.
