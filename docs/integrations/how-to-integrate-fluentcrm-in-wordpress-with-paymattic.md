Now, a pop-up page will appear with various settings options for configuring FluentCRM.
- *All the settings options mentioned in the screenshot below are briefly explained:**
- **Feed Name**: Here, you can set a name according to your preference for your feed. This field is required to be filled in.
- **Primary Fields**: Use all the fields under this option to properly link your FluentCRM Fields with the Form Fields. Also, you can easily select the **Value** for the **Form Fields** according to the **FluentCRM Fields** by using the **Shortcode** button.
- **Other Fields**: Use this option if you need to add your FluentCRM fields beside the primary fields. Here also, you can select the **Value** according to the **FluentCRM Fields** by using the **Shortcode** button.
    
    Add as many **Other Fields** as you need by clicking the **+Add More** button.
    Also, **Delete** any Field by clicking the **Trash Icon** if needed.
- **Contact Tags**: With this option, you can add tags to your FluentCRM contacts.
- **Enable Dynamic Tag Selection**: This option allows you to add customized tags for specific contacts based on your submission values according to your set conditions.

- **Enable Double Opt-In for new contacts**: Enable this option if you want to check the validation of the user information ( specifically user email).
- **Conditional Logics**: This option allows FluentCRM integration to function conditionally based on your submission values according to your set conditional logic/s. Also, here, you can add as much conditional logic as you need by clicking the **+ Add More** button and delete any logic by clicking the **Trash Icon** if needed.
