# How to Integrate FluentCRM in WordPress with Paymattic

[Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/) integrates with [FluentCRM](http://www.fluentcrm.com/), a WordPress-based self-hosted email marketing automation plugin that helps you add new prospects to your FluentCRM contact list when a form is submitted. This article will guide you through integrating **FluentCRM** with **Paymattic** on your WordPress site.

## Enable FluentCRM Integration


First, go to **Integrations** from the **Paymattic Navbar**, search for FluentCRM through the search bar, and you will get the **FluentCRM** integration module.

Before starting the process, ensure you **Installed** and **Activated** the FluentCRM Plugin in your WordPress Site.

Now, a pop-up page will appear with various settings options for configuring FluentCRM. 

**All the settings options mentioned in the screenshot below are briefly explained:**

* **Feed Name:** Here, you can set a name according to your preference for your feed. This field is required to be filled in.
* **Primary Fields:** Use all the fields under this option to properly link your FluentCRM Fields with the Form Fields. Also, you can easily select the Value for the Form Fields according to the FluentCRM Fields by using the Shortcode button. 
* **Other Fields:** Use this option if you need to add your FluentCRM fields beside the primary fields. Here also, you can select the **Value** according to the **FluentCRM Fields** by using the **Shortcode** button.

Add as many Other Fields as you need by clicking the **+Add More** button. Also, Delete any Field by clicking the **Trash** Icon if needed.

* **Contact Tags:** With this option, you can add tags to your FluentCRM contacts.
* **Enable Dynamic Tag Selection:** This option allows you to add customized tags for specific contacts based on your submission values according to your set conditions.
* **Skip if contact already exists in Fluent CRM:** Enable this option if you do not want redundancy in your contact list. 
* **Enable Double Opt-In for new contacts:** Enable this option if you want to check the validation of the user information ( specifically user email). 
* **Conditional Logics:** This option allows FluentCRM integration to function conditionally based on your submission values according to your set conditional logic/s. Also, here,  you can add as much conditional logic as you need by clicking the **+ Add More** button and delete any logic by clicking the **Trash Icon** if needed. To learn more, read this [Documentation](/how-to-use-conditional-logic-in-form-fields-with-paymattic). 
* **Enable This Feed:** Check this option, to ensure this integration feed remains enabled, and all the actions of this feed function properly.
Once the setup is done, finally, click the **Create FluentCRM Feed** button.
And, your FluentCRM will be integrated into this specific form.
