# Add First & Last Name Fields Separately

We often receive inquiries about adding the **First Name** and **Last Name** fields separately, horizontally or vertically, in a Payattic Form. This article will guide you through adding the First and Last Name fields in the [Paymattic](http://paymattic.com) forms.

## Adding First & Last Name Fields 

Open your **Desired Form** where you wish to add the **First** & **Last Name** fields.

>[!Note]
>If you do not have any existing forms, read this [Create a Form](../form-editor/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) from Scratch or Create a Form [Using templates](../form-editor/simple-form-templates) documentation to create one.

For example, here, I used an existing blank form to show the whole process.

Once you open the **Editor** page, add the necessary fields by typing the “** /** ” or clicking the **Plus Icon** placed at the bottom.

>[!Note]
>Now, from the [General Fields](/how-to-use-general-form-input-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic) section, you can either choose the Two Column Container field to display two different fields horizontally or select the Name field twice to show them vertically.

![Choose field type](/images/faq/add-first-last-name-fields-in-a-form/3.-Select-either-Name-or-Two-Column-Container-field.webp)

For example, I chose the **Two Column Container** field under the **General Fields** section to display the First and Last Name fields in one frame horizontally.

![Add container](/images/faq/add-first-last-name-fields-in-a-form/4.-Two-Column-Container.webp)

Here, you can see two columns are added.
Now, you can separately add **Name** fields **Two Times** inside these **Two Added Columns**.

To add **Name** fields, click the **Plus Icon** of each column.

Once you click the **Plus Icon**, it will redirect you again to the **Choose form field** page from where select the **Name** field options and it will be added to your form.

## Customizing the Added Fields

After adding the fields, change the name of the fields from **Your Name** to **First Name** and **Last Name** respectively by clicking the **Pencil/Edit** icon.

>[!Note]
>"To ensure the fields function properly, you need to change the field names at the **Admin Label** in the **Advanced Settings** of the **Name** field as well.
>
>If you do not change the names in the Admin Label, you will not see the added name fields separately (e.g., in the Entries, PDF file, and overall Admin backend) except the form preview only."

![Edit labels](/images/faq/add-first-last-name-fields-in-a-form/6.-Pencil-Icon.webp)

To change the name in the **Admin Label**, click the **Settings Icon** of the **Name** fields.

Now, go to the **Advanced Settings**, write the desired name in the **Admin Label** box, and click the **Update** button. 

For example, here, I wrote First Name for the First Name field.

- [Advanced field settings](../form-editor/how-to-use-conditional-logic-in-form-fields-with-paymattic)

## Save and Preview

Once you change the fields’ names from Your Name to **First Name** and **Last Name** respectively, press the **Save** button to save all the changes.

If you want to see the **Preview** of the form, click the **Eye** icon.

Also, to embed and display the form on a specific Page/Post, **copy** this **Shortcode** and paste it into your desired Page/Post.

![Save options](/images/faq/add-first-last-name-fields-in-a-form/7.-Save-preview-shortcode-buttons.webp)

Here, you can see the preview of the separately added First Name and Last Name fields.
