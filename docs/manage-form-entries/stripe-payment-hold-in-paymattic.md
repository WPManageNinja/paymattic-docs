# How to Enable Stripe Payment Hold in Paymattic

[Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/) supports [Stripe](http://stripe.com)'s payment hold feature, which allows you to temporarily reserve funds from a customer's payment method without immediately capturing them. This is useful when you need to verify order details or ensure product availability before finalizing a transaction.

## Enable Place a Hold on a Payment

To learn how to enable Place a Hold on a Payment, follow the steps with the screenshots below – 

First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Pymattic Navbar**, and open a Payment Form by clicking the **Pencil** icon with the **Stripe** payment method added.

If you do not have any existing Payment form, read this [Documentation](/how-to-create-your-first-payment-form-in-a-minute-and-accept-payments-with-paymattic) to learn how to Create a Payment Form.

For example, I choose an existing **Payment Form** to show the whole process.

Once you open the Editor page, click on the Settings icon of the added [Stripe payment method](/how-to-configure-stripe-payment-gateway-in-wordpress-with-paymattic) field.

Now, click the **Toggle** button to enable the **Place a hold on a payment** option for Stripe.

Then, a confirmation message will appear, click on the **Confirm** button, and then the **Update** button.
And, your **Place a Hold on a  Payment** option will be enabled!

## Capture the Hold Payment

Once the Hold Payment option for Stripe is enabled in a specific Payment Form, **Authorized** payment status will appear in the form entries after each form submission.

To learn how to capture the hold payments through Stripe in a Payment form, follow the steps with the screenshots below – 

First, go to **Paymattic Dashboard** from the WordPress Left Sidebar, click the **Entries** section, and click the **View Details** button of the desired authorized form entry.

Now, you can capture the payment by clicking the **Capture** button. Also, if you want to capture the payment amount from the Stripe dashboard, click the **View on Stripe** button.

:::warning Stripe Dashboard Capture
Remember, to capture the payment from **Stripe Dashboard** you have to add the **‘charge.capture‘** webhook. To know how to add this webhook you can follow this Documentation.

After clicking on the **Capture** button a Capture Payment popup will come.
Now input the amount you want to capture and click the **Capture** button. 

For example, here I captured 5 dollars out of 10 dollars.

Example: Capturing $5 from a $10 held payment:

![Capture amount](/images/manage-form-entries/stripe-payment-hold-in-paymattic/7.-Capture-amount-field.webp)

In your Payment Form Entries, now you will see that Uncaptured Paymnet has been Partially Refunded.
You can also change the **Partially Refunded** payment status by clicking the **Change Payment Status button**.

Now, select a new payment status that fits your needs and click the **Confirm** button.
Also, if you want, you can add a **Note** for this entry during the status change.

## Payment Refund Activity Details 

You will find all payment activity details, including refunded payments, in the Submission Activity Events section of the single entry page.

Find all payment activities, including refunds and captures, in the **Submission Activity Events** section of the entry details:
