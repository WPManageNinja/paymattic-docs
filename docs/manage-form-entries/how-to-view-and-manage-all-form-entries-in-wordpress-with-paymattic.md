- *All the available options mentioned above to view form entries are explained below:**

### A. Payment Status Filter

Using this option, you can filter the form entries based on the payment status. Here, you can see the following payment statuses:
- Paid
- Processing
- Pending
- Failed
- Refunded
- Abandoned

For example, I chose the **Paid** tab as the payment status filter and here you can see all the form entries appear based on paid submissions. In the same way, you can filter your form entries based on any payment status according to your needs.
