**All the available options mentioned above to view form entries are explained below:**

### A. Payment Status Filter

Using this option, you can filter the form entries based on the payment status. Here, you can see the following payment statuses:

* Paid 
* Processing
* Pending
* Failed
* Refunded
* Abandoned

**Example:** I chose the **Paid** tab as the payment status filter and here you can see all the form entries appear based on paid submissions. In the same way, you can filter your form entries based on any payment status according to your needs.

### B. Subscription
By selecting this option, you can view only those form entries that have a successful subscription.

Click the filter option and a dropdown list will appear with all the available forms on your site. Now, select your preferred form to view all entries for that form.
