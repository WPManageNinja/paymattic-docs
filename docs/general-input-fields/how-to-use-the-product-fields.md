# How to Use the Donation & Product Fields

[Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/) provides 10 product fields to design a standard payment form for your WordPress Site. This article will give you an overview of Paymattic's General Fields.

## Getting Product Fields Section

To learn how you can find the Product Fields section, follow the steps with the screenshots below –

First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Paymattic Navbar**, choose a **Form**, and click the **Pencil/Edit** icon to open the **Editor** page of that form.

If you do not have any existing form, read this [Create a Form from Scratch](/form-editor/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) or [Create a Form using Templates](/form-editor/simple-form-templates) documentation to create one.

For example, I choose an existing form to show the whole process.

Once you open the **Editor** page, type the **"/"** or click the **"+"** icon placed at the bottom to get the Product Fields section.

![Add Field Options](/images/general-input-fields/how-to-use-the-product-fields/type-2222-or-click-2222-to-get-payment-method-fields-1.webp)

On the **Choose form field** page, you will find all the desired **Product fields** under the **Donation & Product Fields** section.

Now, you can select any field/s according to your needs by simply clicking on its name.

::: tip Pro Features
Fields with a Star Sign (⭐) in the right corner are Pro features. You need to install and activate the Paymattic Pro plugin to use them.
