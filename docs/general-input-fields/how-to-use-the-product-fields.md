[Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/) provides 10 product fields to design a standard payment form for your WordPress Site. This article will give you an overview of Paymattic's General Fields.

But to get access to the premium fields, you must have the [Paymattic Pro](/# 1-toc-title) plugin.

## Getting Product Fields Section

To learn how you can find the Product Fields section, follow the steps with the screenshots below –

First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Pymattic Navbar,** choose a **Form,** and click the **Pencil/Edit** icon to open the **Editor** page of that form.

If you do not have any existing form, read this [Create a Form from Scratch](/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) or [Create a Form using Templates](/simple-form-templates) documentation to create one.

For example, I choose an existing form to show the whole process.

Once you open the **Editor** page, type the **“ / ”** or click the **“ + ”** icon placed at the bottom to get the Product Fields section.

On the **Choose form field** page, you will find all the desired **Product fields** under the **Donation &amp; Product Fields** section.

Now, you can select any field/s according to your needs by simply clicking on its name.

Remember, **Fields with a Star Sign** in the right corner **are Pro features**. You need to install and activate the [Paymattic Pro](/# 1-toc-title) plugin to use them.
