## Getting General Fields Section

To learn how you can find the General Fields section, follow the steps with the screenshots below –

First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Pymattic Navbar,** choose a **Form,** and click the **Pencil/Edit** icon to open the **Editor** page of that form.

If you do not have any existing form, read this [Create a Form from Scratch](../form-editor/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic.md) or [Create a Form using Templates](../form-editor/simple-form-templates.md) documentation to create one. **For example,** I choose an existing form to show the whole process.
