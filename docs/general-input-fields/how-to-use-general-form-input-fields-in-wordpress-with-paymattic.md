Only to get access to the **File Upload** and **Mask Input** fields, you must have the [Paymattic Pro](/# 1-toc-title) plugin.

## Getting General Fields Section

To learn how you can find the General Fields section, follow the steps with the screenshots below –

First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Pymattic Navbar,** choose a **Form,** and click the **Pencil/Edit** icon to open the **Editor** page of that form.
