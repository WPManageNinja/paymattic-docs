## Payment Method Fields Section

To learn how you can find the Payment Method Fields section, follow the steps with the screenshots below â€“

First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Paymattic Navbar**, choose a **Form**, and click the **Pencil/Edit** icon to open the **Editor** page of that form.

If you do not have any existing form, read this [Create a Form from Scratch](/form-editor/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic) or [Create a Form using Templates](/form-editor/simple-form-templates) documentation to create one.

For example, I choose an existing form to show the whole process.

![Open Form Editor](/images/general-input-fields/how-to-use-the-payment-method-fields-section/open-desired-form-1-scaled.webp)

Once you open the **Editor** page, type the **"/"** or click the **"+"** icon placed at the bottom to get the Payment Method Fields section.

On the **Choose form field** page, you will find all the desired **payment gateways** under the **Payment Method Fields** section.

But, you will only see the Payment Method Fields that you have already configured on your site through Paymattic. To learn the Configuration process of Payment Gateways, [click here](/payment-method-fields/all-payment-method) and read all documentation.

## Types of Adding Payment Method Fields

In Paymattic, you can add the payment method to a form in two different ways. These are:
- Single Payment Method
- Multiple Payment Method

### Single Payment Method

You can add a **Single Payment Method** by clicking on any desired payment gateway's name.

### Multiple/Choose Payment Method

You can add **Multiple Payment Methods** in one form, by clicking the **Choose Payment Method** field.

Once you add the field, you can see that the **Stripe** payment gateway is added by default.

Now, hover over the field and click the **Settings** icon in the right corner to add more payment methods according to your preference.

![Settings Icon](/images/general-input-fields/how-to-use-the-payment-method-fields-section/Settings-Icon-of-Payment-Method-field.webp)

Once you click the **Settings Icon**, two settings options will appear. These are:
- General Settings
- Advanced Settings

### General Settings

Under the General settings tab, you will get the following settings options:

1. Select Payment Method
2. Payment Method Settings
3. Default Payment Method
4. Enable Image

Once you set up all the settings, click the **Update** button to save all the customizations.

::: tip General Settings
All the General Settings mentioned above are explained below:

#### A. Select Payment Method

Here, you can select the preferred payment gateways you want to offer to your customers.
Also, you can select all payment methods by simply clicking the **Check all** button.

#### B. Payment Method Settings

With this option, you can configure a few necessary settings for your selected payment methods. As an example, I described the settings of **Stripe** below:

- **Checkout Display Style**: Select this **Stripe Hosted Checkout** as the checkout display style to take users to the Stripe Hosted page during checkout. Or, select this **Embedded Checkout Field** to display the checkout option as a pop-up. But we always recommend the first option to set as a checkout style.
- **Place a hold on a payment**: Stripe will place a hold on the payment method, basically when you create a payment, you can place a hold on an eligible payment method to reserve funds that you can capture later. If the payment is not captured before the expiring date, the hold amount will be released to the customer's account. To learn how to place a hold on a payment method that works and its benefits, read this [Documentation](/payment-method-fields/stripe-payment-hold-in-paymattic).
- **Require Billing Info**: Enabling this option will allow you to make the billing info required for your users.
- **Verify Zip/Postal Code**: You can also verify zip/postal code by enabling the Verify Zip/Postal Code option. Now press the Update button.

#### C. Default Payment Method

When you add multiple payment methods to collect payments, you can select one payment platform as a default method from the dropdown list of all added payment methods.

#### D. Enable Image

Enable this **Toggle** button to show the Payment Method Platforms' official logo images on your form. Otherwise, only the payment platforms' **Names** will be visible on your form.

### Advanced Settings

Once you complete the General settings, go to the **Advanced** tab, and you will find the advanced settings for your chosen field.
- **Admin Label**: This label is used for the admin who wants to see the field's label from the back end.
- **Field Wrapper CSS Class**: This is used for adding a Custom CSS/JS for an entire field of a specific form using the Field Wrapper CSS Class element. To learn more, click [here](/form-settings/how-to-create-custom-css-js-in-wordpress-with-paymattic).
- **Field ID**: This option is used for adding or tracking form fields. Plus, creating the custom CSS/JS for a specific form field.

Once you finish, click the **Update** button to save all your configuration.

## Preview of Payment Methods Fields

Once you complete adding/editing the Payment Method field, press the **Save** button to save all your changes. And, to see the **Preview** of the form, click the **Eye** icon.

Remember, your Payment Method field will not work until you have any [Product Field](/general-input-fields/how-to-use-the-product-fields) in your form. For example, I added the [Payment Item](/donation-and-product-fields/how-to-add-payment-item-fields-in-wordpress-with-paymattic) field as a product field.

Here is the **preview** of the added **Payment Method** fields in a **Form**.
