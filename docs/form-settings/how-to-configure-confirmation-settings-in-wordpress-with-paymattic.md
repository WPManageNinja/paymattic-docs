[Paymattic](https://paymattic.com/) offers the **Confirmation** settings option which allows you to define and display a confirmation message once each form on your website is submitted. This article will guide you through the process of Configuring Confirmation of Forms in Paymattic.

## Configuring Confirmation Settings

To learn how to configure **Confirmation Settings** of a specific form, follow the steps with the screenshots below –

First, go to the **All Forms** section from the **Pymattic Navbar,** choose a **Form,** and click the **Pencil/Edit** icon to open the **Editor** page of that form.

If you do not have any existing forms, read this [Create a Form from Scratch](../form-editor/how-to-create-a-form-from-scratch-with-paymattic.md) or [Create a Form using Templates](../form-editor/simple-form-templates.md) documentation to create one.

For example, I choose an existing form to show the whole process.

Once you open the **Editor** page, go to the **Settings** tab from the left sidebar, and you will get the **Confirmation** settings option.

Here you will get the four types of Confirmation Settings tab. These are:

1. Form Confirmation Settings
2. Receipt Customization
3. reCaptcha Settings
4. Turnstile Settings

- *All the confirmation settings mentioned above are explained below –**

### 1. Form Confirmation Settings

This feature allows you to customize the confirmation settings for form submissions.
- **Confirmation Type**: This setting allows you to choose where the confirmation message will appear after a payment form is submitted. You can choose to display it on the **same page**, on a different page (**To a Page**), **or** on a specific post (**To a Post)**. Alternatively, you can generate a custom URL (**To a Custom URL**) to display the confirmation message or report based on your settings.
- **Message to Show**: Type custom text in this box to define the content you want to show in your confirmation message. You can also **Add** **Shortcode/s** to fetch other necessary information.
- **After Form Submission**: After submitting a payment form, you can decide whether you want to **Hide** or **Reset** the form.

Once you are done, click the **Save Confirmation Settings** button to save all changes.

### 2. Receipt Customization

The Receipt Customization tab lets you customize the content of the receipt that will be shown along with the confirmation message.
- **Receipt Header Content**: Type custom text in this box to define the content that you would like to show your users on the header of the receipt. You can also **Add** **Shortcode/s** to fetch other necessary information.
- **Receipt Header Content**: As in the Header Content box, you can define the content of the footer in the Footer Content box. You can also **Add** **Shortcode/s** to fetch other necessary information.
- **Show Order Item details in the receipt (if any)**: Enable this button to display all the products or services that are ordered by the user.
- **Show Submission info in the receipt**: Check the button to display all the data that was filled in by the user in the form.

After customizing everything, click the **Save Receipt Settings** button to save all changes.
